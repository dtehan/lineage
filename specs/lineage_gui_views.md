- Update GUI tests to cover the new functionality for views.

## Success Criteria
- Users can see views in the lineage GUI alongside tables.
- Lineage for views is accurately represented, showing dependencies on tables.
- Views are visually distinct from tables.
- Filtering options for tables and views work correctly.
