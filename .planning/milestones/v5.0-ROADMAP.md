# Milestone v5.0: Comprehensive Documentation

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-08
**Phases:** 24-27
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

Enable new teams to deploy and operate the lineage application using documentation alone.

**Target deliverables:**
- Update 4 README files to match current code (root, lineage-api, lineage-ui, database)
- Refresh user guide with v4.0 features (pagination, detail panel, animations)
- Create operations/deployment guide (installation, configuration, database setup, production hardening)
- Create developer manual (environment setup, testing guide, architecture overview, contributing guidelines)

## Phases

### Phase 24: README Updates

**Goal**: All four README files accurately describe the current state of the codebase so someone browsing the repo understands what each component does and how to run it

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v5.0)

**Requirements**: README-01, README-02, README-03, README-04, README-05, README-06, README-07, README-08, README-09, README-10

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Someone cloning the repo can follow root README quick start commands and get the application running without errors
2. Root README accurately lists v4.0 features (detail panel, animations, statistics/DDL) and links to user guide, ops guide, and dev manual
3. lineage-api README describes hexagonal architecture (domain/application/adapter) and provides working commands for both Python and Go servers
4. lineage-ui README describes the React component structure including v4.0 components (DetailPanel, Toolbar, LineageTableView) and provides working dev/build/test commands
5. database README explains OL_* schema, OpenLineage alignment, both lineage population methods (fixtures vs DBQL), and provides working test commands

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 24-01-PLAN.md — Rewrite root README with v4.0 features, quick start, architecture diagram, doc links
- [x] 24-02-PLAN.md — Create lineage-api and lineage-ui READMEs, update database README testing section

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Root README upgraded from 34-line WIP stub to 142-line production README with 11 features
- Mermaid architecture diagram showing frontend-backend-database flow
- Self-contained 6-step quick start with prerequisites
- Component READMEs created for lineage-api and lineage-ui
- Database README updated with testing section

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Mermaid diagram for architecture visualization (GitHub renders natively)
- Included ops guide and dev manual links with "coming in v5.0" annotation
- Kept CLAUDE.md link as AI development reference alongside human-facing docs

### Phase 25: User Guide Refresh

**Goal**: The user guide documents every user-facing feature so someone can learn the full application without external help

**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)

**Requirements**: USER-01, USER-02, USER-03, USER-04, USER-05, USER-06, USER-07, USER-08, USER-09, USER-10, USER-11

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Someone reading the user guide can navigate the asset browser with pagination, change page sizes, and understand the browsing workflow
2. Someone reading the user guide understands all graph controls (depth, direction, fit-to-selection) and what the loading progress stages mean
3. Someone reading the user guide can use the detail panel to inspect table statistics, view DDL/SQL with syntax highlighting, and click columns to navigate lineage
4. Someone reading the user guide can use search to find databases, tables, and columns
5. Key features are illustrated with screenshots showing actual application UI

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 25-01-PLAN.md — Update user guide content: asset browser, loading progress, toolbar controls, detail panel tabs, search
- [x] 25-02-PLAN.md — Add screenshot references and create screenshots directory with capture guide

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Loading Progress section documenting 3-stage progress bar (fetching, layout, rendering) with ETA
- Detail Panel section rewritten with complete 3-tab interface (Columns/Statistics/DDL)
- Toolbar Controls updated with Fit to Selection and Asset Type Filter
- Search section updated to reflect grouped results (Databases/Tables) with expandable items
- 10 coarse-grained screenshots added to resist UI rot with descriptive alt text

**Key Decisions:**
- Document Asset Browser without pagination controls (component does not implement them despite tests existing)
- Added Asset Type Filter to toolbar docs (existed in component but was undocumented)
- Kept Edge/Connection Details as separate subsection (not a tab) matching actual implementation
- 10 coarse-grained screenshots to resist UI rot, with descriptive alt text as fallback documentation

### Phase 26: Operations Guide

**Goal**: An operations team can deploy the application to production from scratch using only the ops guide

**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)

**Requirements**: OPS-01, OPS-02, OPS-03, OPS-04, OPS-05, OPS-06, OPS-07, OPS-08, OPS-09, OPS-10, OPS-11, OPS-12

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Someone can follow the guide to install all prerequisites (Go, Node.js, Python, Teradata access) and complete a step-by-step deployment
2. Someone can configure the application using the documented environment variables (TERADATA_*, API_PORT, Redis) without reading source code
3. Someone can set up the database schema (OL_* tables), enable QVCI, and populate lineage data using documented procedures
4. Someone can harden the deployment for production using documented security requirements (auth proxy, TLS, CORS, rate limiting) and the deployment architecture diagram
5. Someone can diagnose and resolve common issues using the troubleshooting section

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md — Create operations guide with prerequisites, installation, configuration, database setup, running the application
- [x] 26-02-PLAN.md — Add production deployment, architecture diagram, and troubleshooting sections

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Complete environment variable reference table (12 variables with defaults, required status)
- QVCI documented in Prerequisites (early warning) and Database Setup (verification/enablement)
- Both Python and Go backends documented; frontend dev server vs production build distinguished
- Production security requirements with auth proxy patterns (Traefik, Nginx, K8s examples)
- Deployment architecture diagram with Mermaid
- Troubleshooting section with 10 issues in Symptoms/Cause/Solution format

**Key Decisions:**
- QVCI called out in Prerequisites as early warning, detailed procedure in Database Setup
- Python backend recommended for most deployments, Go backend for high-concurrency
- Redis documented as optional throughout (Prerequisites, Config, Startup Order)
- Rate limiting uses v* wildcard endpoints to cover both v1 and v2 API versions
- Troubleshooting uses consistent Symptoms/Cause/Solution format across all 10 issues

### Phase 27: Developer Manual

**Goal**: A new developer can set up a local environment, run all test suites, understand the architecture, and contribute code using only the dev manual

**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)

**Requirements**: DEV-01, DEV-02, DEV-03, DEV-04, DEV-05, DEV-06, DEV-07, DEV-08, DEV-09, DEV-10, DEV-11, DEV-12, DEV-13, DEV-14, DEV-15, DEV-16

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. A new developer can set up a complete local environment (Python venv, Node.js/npm, .env, database) following the documented steps without asking for help
2. A new developer can run all four test suites (73 database, 20 API, 444+ frontend unit, 34 E2E) using the documented commands and understand what each suite validates
3. A new developer understands the hexagonal architecture (Go backend layers), React frontend structure (components/features/stores), and OpenLineage schema from the architecture documentation and diagrams
4. A new developer knows the code standards (Go, TypeScript, SQL), commit message conventions, and PR process before submitting their first contribution

**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 27-01-PLAN.md — Create developer manual with quick start, environment setup, and running tests
- [x] 27-02-PLAN.md — Add architecture overview, backend/frontend architecture, database schema, API reference, and code standards
- [x] 27-03-PLAN.md — Add contributing guidelines (commit conventions, PR process) and update root README link

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Developer manual with 10 sections (699 lines total)
- 7-step Quick Start to get app running in 10 minutes
- Environment Setup referencing ops guide with 4 clickable anchor links
- All 5 test suites documented (73 database, 20 API, ~558 unit, 34 E2E, Go backend)
- Architecture Overview with Mermaid system architecture diagram
- Backend Architecture with hexagonal pattern diagram and 5 repository interfaces
- Frontend Architecture with directory tree and data flow patterns
- Database & Schema with ER diagram and 9-table reference
- API Reference with v2 endpoint table (6 endpoints)
- Code Standards summarizing Go, TypeScript, SQL with links to canonical specs/
- Contributing section with commit conventions (6 types) and PR process (5 steps)

**Key Decisions:**
- Used ~558 for frontend unit test count (approximate, changes as tests are added)
- Documented 6 Python packages from actual requirements.txt
- Playwright port :5173 documented as distinct from dev server :3000
- Added extra rows to coding standards summary tables (Naming for Go, State for TS, Performance for SQL)
- All three DEV-16 diagram types embedded as Mermaid: system architecture, hexagonal architecture, database ER
- Summarize-and-link pattern used for all coding standards (summary table + link to ../specs/ canonical file)
- No CI/CD references beyond disclaimer note — matches project reality (no pipelines or branch protection)
- Project structure reference maps 9 change types to directories for fast contributor navigation

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Summarize-and-link pattern for code standards | Avoid duplication; keep canonical truth in specs/ | ✓ Complete - Developer manual has summary tables linking to specs/coding_standards_*.md |
| Mermaid diagrams for architecture | GitHub native rendering, easier to maintain than ASCII art | ✓ Complete - 5 Mermaid diagrams (root README, ops guide, dev manual x3) |
| 10 coarse-grained screenshots | Resist UI rot compared to pixel-perfect screenshots | ✓ Complete - Screenshots with descriptive alt text as fallback documentation |
| QVCI early warning in Prerequisites | Requires DBA coordination and maintenance window | ✓ Complete - Called out in Prerequisites, detailed in Database Setup |
| Python backend as default recommendation | Most deployments don't need high-concurrency | ✓ Complete - Python documented first, Go positioned for scale |
| Redis documented as optional | Prevent deployment delays if Redis unavailable | ✓ Complete - Optional noted in Prerequisites, Config, Startup Order |
| Document actual component behavior, not test expectations | Avoid confusing users with features that don't exist | ✓ Complete - Asset Browser documented without non-existent pagination controls |
| Reference-not-duplicate pattern | Dev manual links to ops guide for setup details | ✓ Complete - 4 clickable anchor links from dev manual to ops guide |

**Issues Resolved:**

- Root README was outdated 34-line WIP stub — now comprehensive 142-line production README
- User guide missing v4.0 features (detail panel, animations, loading progress) — all documented
- No operations/deployment documentation — complete ops guide created
- No developer onboarding documentation — complete dev manual created
- Component READMEs missing — all three created (lineage-api, lineage-ui, database)

**Issues Deferred:**

None - comprehensive documentation complete for v5.0.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - documentation-only milestone with no code changes.
