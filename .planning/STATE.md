## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions:
- [24-02]: Include all Makefile targets and package.json scripts in component READMEs (verified from source)
- [24-02]: Minimal database/README.md changes -- only add Testing section and back-link
- [24-01]: Used Mermaid diagram for architecture visualization (GitHub renders natively)
- [24-01]: Included ops guide and dev manual links with "coming in v5.0" annotation
- [24-01]: Kept CLAUDE.md link as AI development reference alongside human-facing docs
- [v5.0 roadmap]: 4 phases from 4 natural doc groupings (READMEs, User Guide, Ops Guide, Dev Manual)
- [v5.0 roadmap]: All phases independent -- can execute in any order
- [v5.0 roadmap]: No research phase needed -- introspective documentation of existing codebase

### Pending Todos

1. Views not showing their column types (2026-01-31, area: ui)
2. Optimize view column type extraction to in-database process (2026-02-01, area: database)
3. Refactor COLUMN_LINEAGE_MAPPINGS to test fixtures (2026-02-01, area: database)
