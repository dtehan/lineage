## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Document auth/rate limiting instead of implementing (assumes deployment behind auth proxy)
- [Init]: Fix one concern at a time with tests (ensures verifiability and atomic commits)
- [Init]: MaxDepth limit of 20 (prevents expensive recursive CTE queries)
- [Init]: Pagination page size of 100 (balanced between UI usability and API payload size)
