# Project State

## Current Position

**Phase:** Not started (defining requirements)
**Plan:** —
**Status:** Defining requirements for milestone v1.0
**Last activity:** 2026-02-13 — Milestone v1.0 started

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Enable accurate impact analysis for database changes by visualizing complete column-level lineage across Teradata databases
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.0 initialization

## Accumulated Context

<!-- Project-wide learnings that should persist across milestones -->

### Codebase Insights
- OpenLineage schema (OL_* tables) aligned with spec v2-0-2
- Recursive CTEs handle lineage traversal with path-based cycle detection
- Frontend uses React Flow + ELKjs for graph layout
- DBQL extraction via SQLGlot for Teradata SQL parsing
- 73 database tests validate CTE correctness and schema integrity

### Technical Decisions
- Using DBC.ColumnsJQV (requires QVCI enabled) for complete view column metadata
- DBQL mode is default for production lineage extraction
- Fixtures mode available for demo/testing with hardcoded mappings

### Known Constraints
- QVCI must be enabled on Teradata system for ColumnsJQV queries
- Teradata connection pool size: 1 (single connection per request)
- Recursive CTE depth limited to 5 (default) or 10 (max recommended)
