<objective>
Add screenshot references to the user guide and create the screenshots directory structure for USER-11.

Purpose: Key features are illustrated with screenshots showing actual application UI, making the guide visual and easier to follow.

Output: Updated `docs/user_guide.md` with image references, `docs/screenshots/` directory with a README documenting what each screenshot should capture, and a checkpoint for the user to capture and add actual screenshots.
</objective>

Key findings from research:
- No `docs/screenshots/` directory exists yet
- Screenshots should be at a coarse level (full page or major section, not zoomed-in details) to resist UI rot
- Descriptive captions are essential so the guide is still useful even without the images
- Claude cannot run the app to capture screenshots -- this requires a human checkpoint

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create screenshots directory and add image references to user guide</name>
  <files>docs/screenshots/README.md, docs/user_guide.md</files>
  <action>
**1. Create `docs/screenshots/` directory with a README.md:**

Create `docs/screenshots/README.md` documenting the expected screenshots:

```markdown
# User Guide Screenshots

Screenshots referenced by `docs/user_guide.md`. Each screenshot should be captured at
1280x800 resolution or similar, showing the feature in context.

## Required Screenshots

| Filename | Section | What to Capture |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `asset-browser.png` | Asset Browser | Explore page with sidebar showing expanded database > table > columns hierarchy |
| `lineage-graph.png` | Lineage Graph | A column-level lineage graph showing multiple table nodes with edges and highlighted path |
| `lineage-graph-highlighted.png` | Path Highlighting | Same graph with a column selected showing highlighted path and dimmed non-path nodes |
| `toolbar-controls.png` | Toolbar Controls | The toolbar showing direction dropdown, depth slider, fit-to-selection, export, and view mode toggle |
| `detail-panel-columns.png` | Detail Panel | Detail panel open on Columns tab showing column list with types and lineage counts |
| `detail-panel-statistics.png` | Detail Panel | Detail panel open on Statistics tab showing table metadata |
| `detail-panel-ddl.png` | Detail Panel | Detail panel open on DDL tab showing syntax-highlighted SQL |
| `loading-progress.png` | Loading Progress | The loading progress bar showing a stage message and timing information |
| `search-results.png` | Search | Search results page showing grouped results with expanded items |
| `database-lineage.png` | Database Lineage | Database-level lineage view with Load More button and table count indicator |

## Capture Tips

- Use a browser at 1280x800 or similar resolution
- Use the demo/test data so screenshots are reproducible
- Ensure dark mode is off (default light theme)
- Crop browser chrome if possible (show only the app UI)
```

**2. Add screenshot image references to `docs/user_guide.md`:**

Insert markdown image references at appropriate locations in the user guide. Place each image reference AFTER the section heading and introductory text, BEFORE the detailed feature description. Use relative paths from the docs/ directory.

Locations to insert image references:

- After "### Asset Browser (Explore Page)" intro text (~line 308-310):
  `![Asset Browser showing database hierarchy](screenshots/asset-browser.png)`

- After "### Lineage Graph" intro text (~line 344):
  `![Lineage graph showing column-level data flow](screenshots/lineage-graph.png)`

- After "**Path Highlighting:**" heading (~line 517):
  `![Highlighted lineage path with dimmed non-path nodes](screenshots/lineage-graph-highlighted.png)`

- After "### Toolbar Controls" intro text (~line 407):
  `![Toolbar with direction, depth, fit-to-selection, and export controls](screenshots/toolbar-controls.png)`

- After the new "### Loading Progress" section intro:
  `![Loading progress bar showing stage and timing information](screenshots/loading-progress.png)`

- After "### Detail Panel" intro text, before the tab descriptions:
  `![Detail panel showing the Columns tab](screenshots/detail-panel-columns.png)`

- After Statistics tab description:
  `![Detail panel showing the Statistics tab](screenshots/detail-panel-statistics.png)`

- After DDL tab description:
  `![Detail panel showing DDL with syntax highlighting](screenshots/detail-panel-ddl.png)`

- After "### Search" intro text:
  `![Search results with grouped databases and tables](screenshots/search-results.png)`

- After "### Loading More Tables" intro text:
  `![Database lineage view with Load More pagination](screenshots/database-lineage.png)`

Each image reference should be on its own line with a blank line before and after for proper markdown rendering.

  <verify>
1. `docs/screenshots/README.md` exists with the screenshot inventory table
2. `docs/user_guide.md` contains at least 8 `![...](...screenshots/...)` image references
3. All image references use relative paths starting with `screenshots/`
4. Image references have descriptive alt text
  </verify>
  <done>
Screenshots directory created with README documenting each required screenshot. User guide has inline image references at appropriate locations throughout the document.
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Screenshot references have been added throughout the user guide, pointing to `docs/screenshots/` where actual PNG files need to be captured.

The `docs/screenshots/README.md` documents exactly what each screenshot should show.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the application (backend + frontend)
2. Open `docs/screenshots/README.md` for the screenshot inventory
3. Capture each screenshot listed in the README:
   - Navigate to the relevant feature in the app
   - Take a screenshot at ~1280x800 resolution
   - Save as the specified filename in `docs/screenshots/`
4. Verify the user guide renders correctly with images by previewing the markdown

If screenshots cannot be captured now, the user guide remains functional -- all image references have descriptive alt text that serves as fallback documentation.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if screenshots are captured (or will be captured later), or describe any issues with the image references.</resume-signal>
</task>

After tasks complete:
1. `docs/screenshots/` directory exists with README.md
2. `docs/user_guide.md` contains image references to at least 8 screenshots
3. All image references use correct relative paths (`screenshots/*.png`)
4. Alt text on each image is descriptive enough to understand the feature without seeing the image
5. Markdown formatting is valid (blank lines around image references)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- docs/screenshots/README.md created with screenshot inventory (10 screenshots documented)
- docs/user_guide.md has inline image references at key feature sections
- Each image reference has descriptive alt text
- Human checkpoint reached for actual screenshot capture
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/25-user-guide-refresh/25-02-SUMMARY.md`
