<objective>
Complete the developer manual with contributing guidelines (commit conventions, PR process) and update the root README to link to the finished developer manual.

Purpose: Enable a new developer to submit their first contribution following documented conventions. Also updates the root README now that the dev manual exists. Covers DEV-14, DEV-15, DEV-16.
Output: Contributing section (~100 lines) added to developer manual. Root README updated.

  <name>Task 1: Write Contributing section with commit conventions and PR process</name>
  <files>docs/developer_manual.md</files>
  <action>
Add the final "## Contributing" section to `docs/developer_manual.md` after Code Standards.

**## Contributing (~100 lines):**

**10.1 Development Workflow**
Document the standard development cycle:
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes following code standards (Section 9)
3. Run relevant tests (Section 3)
4. Commit with conventional commit messages (Section 10.2)
5. Push and create a pull request (Section 10.3)

**10.2 Commit Conventions**
Document the conventional commit format extracted from git history:

Format:
```
type(scope): description
```

**Types:**
| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or functionality | `feat(api): add dataset search endpoint` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(graph): correct edge routing for self-referencing tables` |
| `docs` | Documentation changes | `docs(readme): update quick start commands` |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | `test(api): add lineage traversal test cases` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) | `refactor(store): simplify lineage state management` |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies, config | `chore: update Node.js dependencies` |

**Scope:**
- Use the component or area affected: `api`, `ui`, `graph`, `database`, `store`, `readme`
- Phase numbers are used during planned development: `feat(24-01): ...`
- Scope is optional for broad changes: `chore: update dependencies`

**Rules:**
- Description in lowercase, imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature")
- No period at the end
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a body for complex changes (blank line after subject)

**10.3 Pull Request Process**
Document the lightweight PR process that matches project reality:

1. **Branch:** Create a descriptive branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/search-pagination`, `fix/graph-edge-routing`)
2. **Develop:** Make changes, commit incrementally
3. **Test:** Run all affected test suites locally. At minimum:
   - Frontend changes: `npm test` (unit) + `npx playwright test` (E2E)
   - Backend changes: `python tests/run_api_tests.py`
   - Database changes: `python tests/run_tests.py`
4. **Push:** Push your branch to the remote
5. **Create PR:** Open a pull request against `main` with:
   - Clear title following commit convention format
   - Description of what changed and why
   - List of test suites you ran

Note: "This project does not currently have CI/CD pipelines or branch protection rules. All quality assurance is done through local testing and code review."

**10.4 Project Structure Reference**
Brief section pointing developers to key locations when making changes:

| What You're Changing | Where to Look |
|---------------------|---------------|
| API endpoint | `lineage-api/internal/adapter/inbound/http/` (Go) or `lineage-api/python_server.py` (Python) |
| Database query | `lineage-api/internal/adapter/outbound/teradata/` |
| UI component | `lineage-ui/src/components/domain/` |
| Graph behavior | `lineage-ui/src/components/domain/LineageGraph/` |
| State management | `lineage-ui/src/stores/` |
| API hook | `lineage-ui/src/api/hooks/` |
| Database schema | `database/scripts/setup/setup_lineage_schema.py` |
| Lineage data | `database/scripts/populate/populate_lineage.py` |
| Coding standards | `specs/coding_standards_*.md` |

  <verify>Contributing section has 4 subsections (Workflow, Commit Conventions, PR Process, Project Structure Reference). Commit types table has 6 types. PR process has 5 steps. Project Structure Reference has 9 rows mapping changes to directories. No references to CI/CD gates that don't exist.</verify>
  <done>Contributing section documents commit conventions (from git history), PR process (matching project reality), and project structure reference for navigating the codebase.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update root README to link to finished developer manual</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update the root README.md to remove the "coming in v5.0" annotation from the Developer Manual link.

Find the line:
```
| [Developer Manual](docs/developer_manual.md) | Architecture and contributing (coming in v5.0) |
```

Replace with:
```
| [Developer Manual](docs/developer_manual.md) | Architecture, testing, and contributing guidelines |
```

This reflects the actual content now that the dev manual exists: architecture documentation, testing guide, and contributing guidelines.
  </action>
  <verify>The line in README.md no longer contains "coming in v5.0". The Developer Manual link points to docs/developer_manual.md. The description is accurate.</verify>
  <done>Root README links to the developer manual with an accurate description and no "coming in v5.0" placeholder.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Contributing section exists with commit conventions, PR process, and project structure reference
2. Commit convention format matches actual git history (type(scope): description)
3. All 6 commit types documented with examples
4. PR process is lightweight (matches project reality -- no CI/CD references)
5. Project structure reference maps change types to directories
6. Root README links to developer manual without "coming in v5.0"
7. The complete developer manual has all 10 planned sections populated
8. Final document is well-structured, internally consistent, and approximately 900 lines
</verification>

<success_criteria>
A new developer reading the complete manual can:
1. Format commit messages correctly on their first commit
2. Create a pull request following the documented process
3. Know which directory to modify for any given change
4. Understand that quality assurance is local testing (no CI)
5. Find the developer manual linked from the root README
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/27-developer-manual/27-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
