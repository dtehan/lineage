<objective>
Rewrite the root README.md to accurately represent the shipped v4.0 application with complete features, self-contained quick start, architecture diagram, and documentation links.

Purpose: The root README is the front door to the repository. It currently has a WIP banner, 4 basic features, and defers to CLAUDE.md for setup. After this plan, it reflects a shipped product with 11+ features, inline quick start, and links to all documentation.

Output: A complete root README.md (replacing the current sparse 34-line version).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite root README.md with v4.0 content</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
  Rewrite README.md completely. The current file is 34 lines and outdated. Replace it with a comprehensive project README following the section order from RESEARCH.md.

  **Section 1: Title and Description**
  - Title: "Teradata Column Lineage"
  - Remove the WIP banner entirely
  - One-paragraph description: column-level data lineage application for Teradata databases that visualizes data flow between database columns, enabling impact analysis for change management
  - Add a "v4.0" version badge or simple status line like "**Status:** v4.0 -- Production Ready"

  **Section 2: Features**
  Use the verified feature list from RESEARCH.md (11 items):
  - Asset Browser (with pagination 25/50/100/200)
  - Lineage Graph (interactive column-level, upstream/downstream)
  - Detail Panel (tabbed Columns/Statistics/DDL)
  - Statistics (row count, size, owner, dates)
  - DDL Viewer (syntax highlighting via prism-react-renderer)
  - Impact Analysis (downstream effects)
  - Search (databases, tables, columns)
  - Graph Controls (depth, direction, fit-to-selection, export)
  - Smooth Animations (CSS transitions for highlights, panels, selections)
  - Loading Progress (five-stage with ETA)
  - Selection Breadcrumb (database > table > column)

  **Section 3: Quick Start**
  Use the verified commands from RESEARCH.md exactly as written. Include prerequisites line BEFORE the commands: "Requires Python 3.x, Node.js 18+, and Teradata database access."

  Steps:
  1. Clone and setup Python environment (venv, pip install)
  2. Configure database (.env.example -> .env)
  3. Setup database (setup_lineage_schema.py, setup_test_data.py)
  4. Populate lineage data (populate_lineage.py)
  5. Start backend (python python_server.py on :8080)
  6. Start frontend (npm install && npm run dev on :3000)

  Each step must show `cd` commands so paths are explicit. Use code blocks with bash syntax highlighting.

  **Section 4: Technology Stack**
  Table with two columns (Technology, Purpose):
  - Go 1.23 + Chi Router -- Backend API
  - Python 3 + Flask -- Alternative backend
  - React 18 + TypeScript -- Frontend
  - React Flow (@xyflow/react) -- Graph visualization
  - ELKjs -- Graph layout engine
  - TanStack Query -- Data fetching
  - Zustand -- State management
  - Tailwind CSS -- Styling
  - Teradata -- Database
  - Redis -- Cache (optional)

  **Section 5: Architecture**
  Use a Mermaid diagram showing the three-tier architecture:
  ```
  React Frontend --> REST API --> Go/Python Backend --> Teradata + Redis
  ```
  Keep it simple -- 4-5 nodes max. Show the frontend making REST API calls to the backend, which connects to Teradata and optionally Redis.

  **Section 6: Documentation**
  Table with links:
  - [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md) -- Application usage and features
  - [Operations Guide](docs/operations_guide.md) -- Deployment and configuration (coming in v5.0)
  - [Developer Manual](docs/developer_manual.md) -- Architecture and contributing (coming in v5.0)
  - [Security Guide](docs/SECURITY.md) -- Production security requirements
  - [Specifications](specs/) -- Technical specs and test plans
  - [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) -- AI development reference

  **Section 7: Project Structure**
  Brief overview of the three components with links to their READMEs:
  - `lineage-api/` -- Go/Python backend (hexagonal architecture) -- link to lineage-api/README.md
  - `lineage-ui/` -- React frontend (TypeScript, React Flow) -- link to lineage-ui/README.md
  - `database/` -- Schema, scripts, and tests (OpenLineage-aligned) -- link to database/README.md
  - `docs/` -- User and operations documentation
  - `specs/` -- Technical specifications and coding standards

  **Section 8: Testing**
  Summary table with 4 rows:
  | Suite | Tests | Command |
  | Database | 73 | `cd database && python tests/run_tests.py` |
  | Backend API | 20 | `cd lineage-api && python tests/run_api_tests.py` |
  | Frontend Unit | 500+ | `cd lineage-ui && npm test` |
  | Frontend E2E | 34 | `cd lineage-ui && npx playwright test` |

  **Section 9: Configuration**
  Brief paragraph noting .env file support, link to .env.example, and list the key variables: TERADATA_HOST, TERADATA_USER, TERADATA_PASSWORD, TERADATA_DATABASE, API_PORT, REDIS_ADDR. Note that legacy TD_* aliases are still supported.

  **DO NOT:**
  - Duplicate detailed content from component READMEs (architecture details, API endpoints, component trees)
  - Keep ANY reference to "Work In Progress"
  - Defer to CLAUDE.md for quick start (inline it)
  - Use emojis

  1. `wc -l README.md` shows 120+ lines (was 34)
  2. `grep -c "Work In Progress" README.md` returns 0
  3. `grep "Detail Panel" README.md` finds the v4.0 feature
  4. `grep "quick start\|Quick Start" README.md` finds the section
  5. `grep "lineage-api/README.md" README.md` finds the component link
  6. `grep "lineage-ui/README.md" README.md` finds the component link
  7. `grep "database/README.md" README.md` finds the component link

  <done>
  Root README.md is a complete, professional project overview with: no WIP banner, 11 features listed (including v4.0 additions), self-contained quick start with prerequisites, Mermaid architecture diagram, links to all 4 documentation files (2 existing, 2 coming soon), links to all 3 component READMEs, testing summary table, and configuration section. Satisfies README-01, README-02, README-03.
